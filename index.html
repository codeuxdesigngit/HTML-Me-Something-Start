            Julia Tveritina is an artist and a book author from Ukraine who is
            currently living and working as illustrator in China. In 2022 she
            started an illustrated war diary, writing down the stories she heard
            from her family, friends and colleagues in Ukraine.

          <p>
            Somewhere at the beginning of the war (only a week ago) I had
            telephone discussion with Miroslava, the seven-year-old my close
            friend’s daughter, from Irpin. Then I started drawing this graphic
            story about her but couldn't finish it. Every day, reading the posts
            of my friends and relatives stuck in the destroyed cities in
            basements and bomb shelters, short trembling messages from my mom in
            Kyiv, I wanted to add darker details to the story, but finally I
            didn’t. I’m mentally tired. I'll just hope they all will survive.<br /><br />

          <p>
            33th day of war. People who survived and evacuated begin to tell
            their stories. A part of them are my friends and acquaintances, I
            know these families personally. I started to write a diary with
            pictures dedicated to these people. I want Facebook to remind me of
            these posts later, when the war is over. To never forget.<br /><br />

            March 6, 2022. My brave friend Masha takes her daughter Veronika out
            of Irpin, in a half-broken car that was shot earlier in the yard of
            their destroyed house. It was the first days of the war, a lot of
            civilians from Irpin, Bucha and Gostomel tried to leave and escape,
            but not everyone was lucky. Entire families were shot, noone cared
            that the word "children" was written on the cars. <br /><br />

            March 15, 2022. My other close friend Julia finally answered my
            message and said that she had already been evacuated from Bucha to
            Kyiv. "Our entire park zone is covered with huge black holes -
            traces of the bombing. I have nowhere else to walk my dog. A shell
            hit my house - I have nowhere else to live."<br /><br />

          <p>
            36th day of the war with a few words about evacuation. None of my
            family left Kyiv during the war, but I can imagine how deafeningly
            scary it is when you suddenly find yourself at the train station
            with a small bag in your hand, in which there are your passport,
            some food and maybe pair of socks and no return ticket.<br /><br />

            March 10, 2022. My friends, newlyweds Sergiy and Lena said goodbye
            at the railway station in Kyiv. Lena is pregnant and leaves with the
            hope of waiting out the war in Lviv. Her husband leaves for the
            front line. Sergiy is a very peace-loving calm man, he is a big fan
            of tea culture and writes essays on oriental studies. The last thing
            Sergiy wants to do is fight, but he has no choice today, if he wants
            his former life back, like all of us.<br /><br />

            March 11, 2022. Exhausted people sleep on the floor of the
            Poltava-Lviv evacuation train.

          <p>
            40-th day of war. As I wrote earlier, I started a small series of
            illustrations about the war, based on the real stories of my
            eyewitness friends. These are stories of ordinary people who woke up
            on February 24th in a “new wonderful world” in which other people
            want to forcefully and irrevocably change theirs lives.<br /><br />

            March 4th, 2022. Kharkiv city. The children sleep in a basement, on
            the dirt floor. <br /><br />

            April 3, 2022. Bucha. My childhood friend Andrew looks at the river
            through a hole in the bridge, which he passed thousands of times to
            visit grandparents in his pre-war life. This bridge is now covered
            with burnt cars and dead bodies of civilians. It's hard for me to
            write anything objective about Bucha, because I knew this region too
            well. I can only say that I feel the same hole inside right now.
            <br /><br />

            March 19, 2022. My friend Lera from Mariupol. Her father and granny
            died because of shrapnel wounds in the yard of their own house when
            they left the basement to find some food. She was evacuated from the
            Marine Boulevard area along with a dog that she picked up along the
            way. As a result of shelling, 90% of the housing in the city was
            damaged. Mariupol no longer exists.<br /><br />

          <p>
            I don’t remember which day of the war, it seems to be the 43rd. I
            continue illustrated series of stories of my friends. There are good
            news - my dog ​​has finally gotten used to the sounds of exploding
            shells and alarms, and furiously barks back. And of course, the very
            good news is that the front has moved away from Kyiv for a little
            bit, and the dog has nothing to bark at. I don't know for how long.
            <br /><br />

            April 5, 2022. Mariupol. Veronica, my friend Lera's sister, together
            with her neighbors near their house (already almost destroyed, they
            sleep in the basement), cook food on a fire in dug pits. The most
            dangerous thing is to do it under shelling, but in their area it has
            already become calmer. Veronica's neighbor planted flowers in flower
            beds, right in the ground, plowed up by shell fragments. The flowers
            have sprouted. <br /><br />

            February 24, 2022. Kyiv. My friend and colleague Sasha
            @aleksandra.mako writes on her daughter's back: her name, age and
            contact details in case something happens with her in the chaos of
            evacuation. Recently Sasha posted her daughters back photo on
            Instagram and the post went viral. The photo was shared in most
            cases without giving a link to the source, which in turn encouraged
            thousands of "nice" people to write rather cruel comments and call
            the photo a fake. But its not a fake. I cannot be sure about much
            that is happening now, so I use only stories confirmed by a personal
            contact. I would really like it to be fake, staged, or a part of a
            movie, but unfortunately it's all real.<br /><br />

            A message from the artist:
            <br />
            <br />
            Dear friends, I would like to invite you to the presentation of my
            book in Kyiv. <br /><br />
            Personally of course I will not be there (as I live and work in
            China right now), but there will be my publisher Oleg, introducing
            my book and an interesting discussion about modern Ukrainian
            illustration.
