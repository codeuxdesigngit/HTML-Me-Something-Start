            Somewhere at the beginning of the war (only a week ago) I had
            telephone discussion with Miroslava, the seven-year-old my close
            friend’s daughter, from Irpin. Then I started drawing this graphic
            story about her but couldn't finish it. Every day, reading the posts
            of my friends and relatives stuck in the destroyed cities in
            basements and bomb shelters, short trembling messages from my mom in
            Kyiv, I wanted to add darker details to the story, but finally I
            didn’t. I’m mentally tired. I’m just believe they all will survive.
            And there is small good news - the cat of Mira's neighbors was
            finally rescued. 11 days later, a hole was punched in the wall of
            the common corridor and poor creature got out.

            33th day of war. People who survived and evacuated begin to tell
            their stories. The fired thing is that a part of them are my friends
            and acquaintances, I know these families personally. I started to
            keep such a diary in pictures, dedicated to these people. I want
            Facebook to remind me of these posts later, when the war is over. to
            never forget. 1. March 6, 2022, my brave friend Masha takes her
            daughter Veronika out of Irpin , in a half-broken car that was shot
            earlier in the yard of their destroyed house. It was the first days
            of the war, a lot of civilians from Irpin, Bucha and Gostomel tried
            to leave and escape, but not everyone was lucky. entire families
            were shot, no one looked that the word "children" was written on the
            cars. 2. March 15, 2022 . My other close friend Julia finally
            answered my message and said that she had already been evacuated
            from Bucha to Kyiv. ,, Our entire park zone is covered in huge black
            holes - traces of the bombing. I have nowhere else to walk my dog. A
            shell hit my house - I have nowhere else to live

            36th day of the war with a few words about evacuation. None of my
            family left Kyiv during the war , but I can imagine how deafeningly
            scary it is when you suddenly find yourself at the train station
            with a small bag in your hand, in which there are your passport,
            some food and maybe pair of socks and no return ticket. 1. March 10,
            2022. My friends, newlyweds Sergiy and Lena say goodbye at the
            railway station in Kyiv. Lena is pregnant and leaves with the hope
            of waiting out the war in Lviv. Her husband leaves for the front
            line. Sergiy is a very peace-loving calm man, he is big fan of tea
            culture and writes essays on oriental studies. The last thing Sergiy
            wants to do is fight, but he has no choice today, if he wants his
            former life back, like all of us. 2. March 11 , 2022. exhausted
            people sleep on the floor of the Poltava-Lviv evacuation train.
