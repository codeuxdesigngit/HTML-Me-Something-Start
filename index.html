            Somewhere at the beginning of the war (only a week ago) I had
            telephone discussion with Miroslava, the seven-year-old my close
            friend’s daughter, from Irpin. Then I started drawing this graphic
            story about her but couldn't finish it. Every day, reading the posts
            of my friends and relatives stuck in the destroyed cities in
            basements and bomb shelters, short trembling messages from my mom in
            Kyiv, I wanted to add darker details to the story, but finally I
            didn’t. I’m mentally tired. I’m just believe they all will survive.
            And there is small good news - the cat of Mira's neighbors was
            finally rescued. 11 days later, a hole was punched in the wall of
            the common corridor and poor creature got out.
